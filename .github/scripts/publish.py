"""Publish every member of the workspace to crates.io, in dependency order.

`cargo publish --workspace` cannot be resumed. It publishes in dependency order
and waits for each crate to reach the index, but a version that already exists
aborts the whole run, and there is no `--idempotent` to ask otherwise
(rust-lang/cargo#13397). With eleven irreversible uploads, one flaky
upload mid-run would leave the workspace half-published and the retry would
refuse to start.

This script does the same thing with the property that matters: it is safe to
re-run. Each crate is published on its own, and a crate already on the registry
at this version, with the checksum the locally built archive has, counts as
done. Anything else -- a different checksum at that version, a manifest that
disagrees with the workspace version, an upload that fails -- stops the run
before the next crate, so the failure is narrow and the resume is exact.
